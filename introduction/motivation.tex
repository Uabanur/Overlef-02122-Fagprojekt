\subsection{Motivation (Magnus)}
We chose this project mainly for three reasons: First, to gain experience with solving a real-life technical problem while focusing on customer requirements.

Second, to apply knowledge acquired in DTU courses (e.g. Java, Git), and get experience with independently seeking out knowledge required in e.g. SQL and HTML. 

Third, IBM is one of the biggest players in the IT market\cite{wikipedia_it_companies} and a top-10 Fortune 500 company in the technology sector\cite{fortune500}, so the project aligns well with DTU's strategy to work closely with the business community\cite{dtu_strategy}.
