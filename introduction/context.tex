\subsection{Context (Magnus)}
Denmark is one of the most digitized countries in the world, and \#1 in EU\cite{danmark_mest_digi}. The promise is that this will increase productivity\cite{digitalisering_oeger_produktivitet}.  The online bank is an increasingly important aspect of a bank. When customers choose a bank, the online bank is more important than the assigned in-person counsellor\cite{netbank_raadgiver}. Danish customers prefer to manage their day-to-day banking through the online bank, rather than going to the physical bank\cite{netbank_foretrukken}. 88 \% of Danes use online banks\cite{danskere_bruger_netbank}, hence millions non-technical users (and billions worldwide) rely on secure and easy-to-use online bank applications.
