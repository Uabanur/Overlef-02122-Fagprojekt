\subsection{The Mainframe (Jens Carl)}

The mainframe is a large computer  used by big corporations. Multiple systems can be run on the mainframe, and its memory segment can be divided into many independent and isolated logical partitions.

The mainframe has for a long time been one of IBM's signature products\cite{ibm_history_slides}. One of the trademarks of modern IBM mainframes is their extremely high up-time and stability\cite{red_book}. For storage of very important information often accessed (e.g. money), these properties are a must.
