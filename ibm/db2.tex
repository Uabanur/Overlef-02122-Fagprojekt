\subsection{DB2 (Magnus)}
DB2 is a database tool made by IBM. Like other popular database tools, it is relational, i.e. an RDBMS (\textbf{R}elational \textbf{D}ata\textbf{b}ase \textbf{M}anagement \textbf{S}ystem). We use DB2 to store, modify and retrieve data in a database on a z/OS partition on the Mainframe. DB2 can trace it roots back to IBM researcher by E. F. Codd, whose 1970 paper \textit{A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks}\cite{codd} paved the way for the relational database systems in general.

\textbf{Why use DB2?} DB2 is one of the most used database management systems in the world\cite{db2}. While MySQL is free, IBM offers extensive customer support for DB2. DB2 is an IBM product and performs well on z/OS. The DTU course 02170 on database systems uses MySQL instead of DB2, but both systems support the SQL standard. We contacted lecturers of course 02170, and self-studied some SQL.

To access and modify the DB2 database we use the tool Data Studio.
