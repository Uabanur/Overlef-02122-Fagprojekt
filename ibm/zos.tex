\subsection{z/OS (Magnus)}

z/OS is a 64-bit operating system made for IBM mainframes. It supports the other tools used in this project (DB2, Java), but also popular tools like C and COBOL. The Mainframe supports several z/OS partitions to run concurrently with no access to another partition's memory.

\textbf{Why use z/OS?} It is used by Danske Bank, the largest bank in Denmark\cite{danske_pengeinstitutter}. Our online bank application only has $\approx$ 10 users and $\approx 1$ transaction per second, so a household server could host our application. But running the online bank application on the IBM mainframe on a z/OS OS provides \textit{proof of concept} that our application can run on commercially used hardware.
