\subsection{Design (Jens Carl)}
\vspace{-0.2cm}
In sections \ref{sec:usecases} and \ref{sec:design}, use cases and tools were presented. The bank application was to be written in an object-oriented style using Java and make use of a DB2 database. With this in mind, a security level was designed including passwords, input sanitation, authority levels, hidden URLs and data storage stability. Model-view-controller was chosen as the architectural design pattern. This decision was primarily based on our team's previous experience and the scope of the project. All in all, designing from MVC proved to be successful as it was easy to design core features that corresponded to the specification requirements.
