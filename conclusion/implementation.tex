\subsection{Implementation (Roar)}

%conclusion on implementation. what was achieved? what can the app do?

The application was successfully implemented using the Model-View-Controller design pattern. The model is implemented as local classes with internal logic, as well as stored on a DB2 database for future access. The view is created using JSP files, only communicating with the controller through web forms. The controller is divided into three classes, each responsible for specific tasks in the MVC design. The controller manages all interaction between view inputs and the model. The application security is implemented with regards to hiding passwords, minimizing URL information, dividing authority, sanitizing inputs and handling database errors. The resulting implementation of the application satisfies the requirements outlined in section \ref{sec:problemanalysis_requirements}.
