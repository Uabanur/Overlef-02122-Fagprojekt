\subsection{Test (Mikkel)}

During the development progress, we used three types of tests. Early in the process, we used JUnit tests to ensure the stability of the core program. Later, when we had connected the database and finished all core features, we shifted to a 'usability' approach. Instead of testing the code directly, we tested features through the user interface. Finally, we showed our program to people who had not seen it before, and timed them going through a list of actions a user would commonly take. We then used their feedback and data to improve the ease-of-use of the program. We estimated a completely new user would be able to perform all tasks in the task list in 10 minutes or less, but ended up with an average time of 7 minutes.
